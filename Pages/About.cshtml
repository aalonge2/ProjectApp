<h3>What Are Tasks?</h3>
<p>
    In this application, "Tasks" (also called Activities) are individual units of work that need to be completed. Each task has a title and can be assigned to a specific project and delegated to a worker. Think of them as the building blocks of your projects, helping you track progress and manage responsibilities.

<h3>How Do I Use This App?</h3>
<p>
    This application helps you manage projects, workers, and their associated tasks. Here’s a quick guide:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Projects:</strong> Start by creating a project. A project acts as a container for a collection of related tasks.</li>
    <li><strong>Workers:</strong> Add workers to your system. These are the individuals who will be assigned to complete tasks.</li>
    <li><strong>Activities (Tasks):</strong> Once you have projects and workers, you can create activities. When creating an activity, you can give it a title and assign it to both a project and a worker.</li>
    <li><strong>Manage Everything:</strong> Use the navigation links to view lists of all your projects, workers, and activities. You also have the ability to create, edit, or delete any of these items as needed.</li>
</ul>
